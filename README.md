# Target Motion Predictor

## What this does
Tracks a target and predicts where it will be next using a Kalman Filter.

## Why it's useful
This logic is used in drones, missiles, and aircraft guidance.

## How to run
1. Run `python gui.py`
2. Watch the target move
3. See real-time predictions

## Bonus
- Add GPS noise to test the filter
- Export data
- Try nonlinear movement
